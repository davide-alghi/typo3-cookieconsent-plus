Conditions evaluation type
====

Here you have two options:

* **show if ALL conditions** is an AND evaluation: if all conditions are true,
  the Page is visible, else not
* **show if AT LEAST ONE condition** is an OR evaluation: if at least one
  condition is true, the Page is visible; the Page is hidden if all conditions
  are false

Conditions
====

In condition menus (Statistics, Marketing)
three options are available:

* **any value** means that condition is always true
* **denied** means that condition is true when cookies are denied
* **accepted** means that condition is true when chookies are accepted
